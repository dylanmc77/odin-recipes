    <p>This colcannon recipe uses <em>leeks</em> and <em>green cabbage</em> but it tastes <strong>equally</strong> delicious with <em>kale</em>. It is traditional Irish Halloween fare but so comforting, <strong>it's good anytime!</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <ls>1 pound potatoes</ls>
        <ls>1 pound green cabbage, sliced</ls>

    <OL>
        <ls>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain</ls>
        <ls>While potatoes are boiling, simmer or steam cabbage in a separate pot until tender. Drain and chop; set aside and keep warm.</ls>
        <ls>Place leeks in a small pot; add just enough milk to cover. Simmer over low heat until leeks are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes.</ls>
        <ls>Season potatoes with salt, pepper, and mace; mash well. Stir in cooked leeks and milk. Stir in cabbage and heat through until potatoes are pale green in color. Make a well in the center of the colcannon and pour in the melted butter. Mix well and serve.</ls>
